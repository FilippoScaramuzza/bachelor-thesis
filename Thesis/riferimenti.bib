abstract = {Fog Computing extends the Cloud Computing paradigm to the edge of the network, thus
enabling a new breed of applications and services. Defining characteristics of the
Fog are: a) Low latency and location awareness; b) Wide-spread geographical distribution;
c) Mobility; d) Very large number of nodes, e) Predominant role of wireless access,
f) Strong presence of streaming and real time applications, g) Heterogeneity. In this
paper we argue that the above characteristics make the Fog the appropriate platform
for a number of critical Internet of Things (IoT) services and applications, namely,
Connected Vehicle, Smart Grid, Smart Cities, and, in general, Wireless Sensors and
Actuators Networks (WSANs).},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel traffic control architecture which is based on fog computing paradigm and reinforcement leaning technologies. We firstly provide an overview of this framework and detail the components and workflows designed to relieve traffic congestion. These workflows, which are connecting traffic lights, vehicles, Fog nodes and traffic cloud, aim to generate traffic light control flow and communication flow for each intersection to avoid a traffic jam. In order to make the whole city’s traffic highly efficient, the fog computing paradigm and a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm is designed to overcome communication bandwidth limitation and local optimal traffic control flow, respectively. We also demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional systems and provides high practicability in future research for building the intelligent transportation system.}

abstract = {For various reasons, the cloud computing paradigm is unable to meet certain requirements (e.g. low latency and jitter, context awareness, mobility support) that are crucial for several applications (e.g. vehicular networks, augmented reality). To fulfill these requirements, various paradigms, such as fog computing, mobile edge computing, and mobile cloud computing, have emerged in recent years. While these edge paradigms share several features, most of the existing research is compartmentalized; no synergies have been explored. This is especially true in the field of security, where most analyses focus only on one edge paradigm, while ignoring the others. The main goal of this study is to holistically analyze the security threats, challenges, and mechanisms inherent in all edge paradigms, while highlighting potential synergies and venues of collaboration. In our results, we will show that all edge paradigms should consider the advances in other paradigms.}

abstractNote = {NetworkX is a Python language package for exploration and analysis of networks and network algorithms. The core package provides data structures for representing many types of networks, or graphs, including simple graphs, directed graphs, and graphs with parallel edges and self loops. The nodes in NetworkX graphs can be any (hashable) Python object and edges can contain arbitrary data; this flexibility mades NetworkX ideal for representing networks found in many different scientific fields. In addition to the basic data structures many graph algorithms are implemented for calculating network properties and structure measures: shortest paths, betweenness centrality, clustering, and degree distribution and many more. NetworkX can read and write various graph formats for eash exchange with existing data, and provides generators for many classic graphs and popular graph models, such as the Erdoes-Renyi, Small World, and Barabasi-Albert models, are included. The ease-of-use and flexibility of the Python programming language together with connection to the SciPy tools make NetworkX a powerful tool for scientific computations. We discuss some of our recent work studying synchronization of coupled oscillators to demonstrate how NetworkX enables research in the field of computational networks.},
